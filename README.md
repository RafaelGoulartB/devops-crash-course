This app uses Node.js/Express/MongoDB with Google OAuth for authentication

It uses Docker + docker-compose for local execution, Terraform to provision cloud resources, and Github actions for CI/CD.

For full tutorial, see the video I created for the [Traversy Media YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia/videos).

# :computer: Technologies
This project was made using the follow technologies:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)     
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)      
* [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)    
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)     
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/)     

# :rocket: Features

- Create Story
- Dockerized Aplication

# :construction_worker: How to run
Add your **MongoDB URI** and **Google OAuth** credentials to the `config.env` file.    

*MongoDB URI*: `mongodb://mongo:27017/storybooks`

Then run:
```
make run-local
```

This will use docker-compose to build the application into a docker image and then run it alongside a Mongo DB container.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
